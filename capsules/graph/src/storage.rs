//! Storage utilities for graph capsule
//!
//! This module provides helpers to interact with graph storage (GRAPH_COMMITS stream
//! and GRAPH_TAGS KV bucket). Most storage logic is delegated to engine/src/graph/mod.rs.

// Placeholder for future storage utilities
// In production, this would contain helpers for:
// - Tag KV read/write/delete operations
// - Commit replay and reconstruction
// - Graph materialization state management
