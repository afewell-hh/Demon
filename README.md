**Secure, auditable workflow automation with human approval gates and policy enforcement.**

Demon is a meta-platform that bridges the gap between rigid CI/CD pipelines and ungoverned automation. Platform teams get programmable workflow control with built-in approval gates, policy enforcement, and complete audit trails‚Äîwithout sacrificing developer velocity.

## What is Demon?

Demon provides three core pillars for controlled automation:

- **Ritual Engine**: Define workflows as declarative YAML "rituals" that execute with full event traceability
- **Policy Wards**: Enforce quotas, time windows, and approval requirements before any action executes
- **Approval Gates**: Human-in-the-loop controls with configurable TTLs and escalation paths

Unlike general workflow orchestrators, Demon is purpose-built for scenarios where governance, security, and audit requirements are paramount‚Äîthink production deployments, infrastructure changes, and security-sensitive operations.

## Overview & Use Cases

### For Evaluators
- **Controlled Deployments**: Gate production releases behind approvals with automatic rollback on timeout
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Provision cloud resources with policy-enforced quotas and multi-level approvals
- **Security Workflows**: Automate incident response with mandatory security team sign-off

### For Builders
- **WASM-Powered Capsules**: Write workflow logic in any language that compiles to WebAssembly
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Every action generates structured events for monitoring and debugging
- **Contract Registry**: Versioned schemas ensure API compatibility across teams and environments

### For Operators
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Web UI shows live workflow execution with complete event histories
- **Policy Management**: Configure quotas, approval chains, and timeout behaviors without code changes
- **Audit Compliance**: Immutable event streams provide complete audit trails for regulatory requirements

## Try Demon in 5 Minutes

See Demon in action with a simple workflow that showcases the ritual engine, event streams, and approval flow:

```bash
# Start the development environment
make dev

# Run a sample ritual
cargo run -p demonctl -- run examples/rituals/echo.yaml
```

**What you just saw:**
- The **ritual engine** interpreted the YAML workflow and executed the echo capsule
- **Events** were published to NATS JetStream with full traceability (`ritual.started`, `ritual.completed`)
- **Policy decisions** were evaluated (quotas, approval gates) before execution
- A **JSON event stream** captured the entire workflow lifecycle for audit and replay

The echo ritual is intentionally simple‚Äîreal workflows can orchestrate complex approval chains, enforce time-based policies, and integrate with existing CI/CD systems.

### Bootstrap for Self-Hosting

Deploy Demon in your environment with zero-config setup:

```bash
# Complete bootstrap (stream + events + UI verification)
cargo run -p demonctl -- bootstrap --ensure-stream --seed --verify

# Individual steps available
cargo run -p demonctl -- bootstrap --ensure-stream    # Create NATS stream
cargo run -p demonctl -- bootstrap --seed            # Seed sample events
cargo run -p demonctl -- bootstrap --verify          # Verify Operate UI

# Environment overrides supported
RITUAL_STREAM_NAME=PROD_STREAM cargo run -p demonctl -- bootstrap --ensure-stream
```

See [docs/bootstrapper/README.md](docs/bootstrapper/README.md) for production deployment guides.

## Core Capabilities

- **üîí Approval Gates**: REST API for granting/denying approvals with first-writer-wins semantics and TTL auto-deny
- **üìä Policy Engine**: Configurable quotas, time windows, and approval chains with real-time policy decisions
- **üéØ Event Persistence**: All workflow actions stored in NATS JetStream with deterministic replay capability
- **üñ•Ô∏è Operate UI**: Real-time dashboard showing runs, events, and approval status with filtering and search
- **üì¶ Contract Registry**: Versioned schemas and WIT definitions for API compatibility and integration
- **üöÄ Self-Hosting**: Zero-config bootstrap for NATS streams, seed data, and UI verification

## Current Release Status

**Alpha Preview**: All M0 capabilities complete and battle-tested. The platform successfully handles basic rituals, approval workflows, and policy enforcement in development environments.

**Coming in Beta**: Enhanced UI dashboard, multi-tenant support, and advanced policy engine with escalation chains.

**Production Readiness**: Planned for M2 with hardened security, scale testing, and operational runbooks.

## Vision & Community

Demon aims to become the standard for governed automation in cloud-native environments. We're building toward:

- **Universal Integration**: Native connectors for major CI/CD platforms, cloud providers, and security tools
- **Policy-as-Code**: Git-managed policy definitions with automated testing and deployment
- **Enterprise Features**: Advanced audit reporting, compliance frameworks, and organizational controls

## Development

```bash
# Build and test the workspace
make build && make test

# Format and lint (required for CI)
make fmt && make lint

# Quick smoke test
cargo run -p demonctl -- run examples/rituals/echo.yaml
```

**API Examples**:

```bash
# Grant approval (first-writer-wins)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/approvals/{run_id}/{gate_id}/grant \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"approver": "ops@example.com", "note": "approved for production"}'

# Fetch contract bundles
GH_TOKEN=your_token cargo run -p demonctl -- contracts fetch-bundle

# Export all contracts
cargo run -p demonctl -- contracts bundle --format json --include-wit
```
