## Contract Specifications

- **[JSON Schemas](../../contracts/schemas/)** - Event and API data structures
- **[Test Fixtures](../../contracts/fixtures/)** - Golden files for validation
- **[WIT Definitions](../../contracts/wit/)** - WebAssembly Interface Types

## Quick Start

1. **REST API**: Start with `/api/runs` to list available ritual executions
2. **Events**: Subscribe to `ritual.*` events for execution monitoring
3. **Schemas**: Validate payloads against JSON schemas in contracts/

## Authentication

*Authentication documentation will be added as the security model is implemented*

## Rate Limits

*Rate limiting documentation will be added as limits are implemented*
