# Evaluators Guide

Welcome, evaluators! This guide helps you assess Demon for adoption, understand its capabilities, and evaluate fit for your organization.

## üîç Executive Summary

**Demon** is a Meta-PaaS that provides secure, auditable workflow automation with human approval gates and policy enforcement. It's designed for platform teams who need controlled automation without building custom solutions from scratch.

### Key Value Propositions
- **Zero-Config Deployment** - Get running in minutes with `demonctl bootstrap`
- **Human-in-the-Loop** - Approval gates for sensitive operations with TTL auto-deny
- **Policy Enforcement** - Automated quota management and compliance checks
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Built on NATS JetStream for reliability and scale
- **Developer-Friendly** - Rust-based with comprehensive APIs and CLI tools

## üìä Capability Assessment

### Current Status (MVP Complete)
All M0 capabilities are ‚úÖ **Production Ready**:

- ‚úÖ **Basic Ritual Execution** - Run automated workflows with custom capsules
- ‚úÖ **Event Persistence** - Durable event storage with replay capability
- ‚úÖ **Policy Decisions** - Automated quota enforcement and rate limiting
- ‚úÖ **Approval Gates** - Human approval workflows with conflict resolution
- ‚úÖ **TTL Auto-Deny** - Automatic timeout for pending approvals
- ‚úÖ **Operate UI** - Web interface for monitoring and management
- ‚úÖ **REST API** - Programmatic access to runs and approvals
- ‚úÖ **Development Environment** - Complete developer experience

### Roadmap and Maturity
- **M1 Features** ‚úÖ **Complete** - Enhanced UI, multi-tenancy, advanced policies
- **Production Readiness** - Currently deployed and stable
- **Enterprise Features** - In active development

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Engine** (`engine/`) - Minimal ritual interpreter for workflow execution
- **Runtime** (`runtime/`) - Link-name router for capsule management
- **demonctl** (`demonctl/`) - CLI tool for operations and development
- **Operate UI** (`operate-ui/`) - Web interface for monitoring
- **Contracts** (`contracts/`) - JSON schemas and event definitions

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Rust (nightly, edition 2021)
- **Messaging**: NATS JetStream for event persistence
- **Storage**: Event sourcing with durable replay
- **Packaging**: WebAssembly components for capsules
- **Security**: Cryptographic signatures and bundle verification

## üéØ Use Case Fit Analysis

### Ideal Scenarios
- **CI/CD Automation** with approval gates for production deployments
- **Security Compliance** with automated policy enforcement
- **Multi-Stage Approvals** for sensitive operations
- **Event-Driven Workflows** replacing manual processes
- **Platform Engineering** needing controlled automation

### Not Ideal For
- Full workflow orchestration (use GitHub Actions/GitLab CI instead)
- General-purpose messaging (NATS JetStream already handles this)
- User management and authentication (integrate with existing systems)

### Competitive Positioning
| Feature | Demon | Traditional CI/CD | Custom Solutions |
|---------|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Approval Gates | ‚úÖ Built-in | ‚ùå Manual scripts | üî∂ Custom dev |
| Policy Enforcement | ‚úÖ Automated | ‚ùå Manual | üî∂ Custom dev |
| Event Sourcing | ‚úÖ Native | ‚ùå Limited | üî∂ Custom dev |
| Zero-Config Deploy | ‚úÖ `demonctl bootstrap` | ‚ùå Complex setup | ‚ùå Months of work |
| Developer Experience | ‚úÖ CLI + UI + APIs | üî∂ Platform-specific | üî∂ Varies |

## üìà Evaluation Checklist

### Technical Assessment
- [ ] **Performance Requirements** - Can handle your event volume?
- [ ] **Integration Points** - APIs match your existing systems?
- [ ] **Security Model** - Approval and policy model fits your needs?
- [ ] **Operational Complexity** - Team can manage NATS JetStream?
- [ ] **Scalability** - Horizontal scaling meets growth projections?

### Business Assessment
- [ ] **Time to Value** - 5-minute setup vs months of custom development
- [ ] **Maintenance Overhead** - Rust ecosystem fit with team skills?
- [ ] **Vendor Risk** - Open source with clear governance model
- [ ] **Total Cost of Ownership** - Infrastructure + development + operations
- [ ] **Compliance Requirements** - Audit trails and policy enforcement sufficient?

## üöÄ Proof of Concept Guide

### 30-Minute Evaluation
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup (5 minutes)
git clone https://github.com/afewell-hh/demon
cd demon
make dev

# 2. Run first workflow (5 minutes)
cargo run -p demonctl -- run examples/rituals/echo.yaml

# 3. Explore UI (10 minutes)
# Visit http://localhost:3000/runs
cargo run -p demonctl -- bootstrap --verify

# 4. Test approvals API (10 minutes)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/approvals/{run_id}/{gate_id}/grant \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"approver": "eval@company.com", "note": "evaluation approved"}'
```

### Extended Evaluation (1 Week)
1. **Day 1-2**: Set up development environment and run basic workflows
2. **Day 3-4**: Build custom capsule for your use case
3. **Day 5-6**: Test approval workflows and policy enforcement
4. **Day 7**: Evaluate operational requirements and deployment

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Ease of Setup** - Can your team get it running quickly?
- **API Quality** - Do the REST APIs meet your integration needs?
- **Approval UX** - Does the approval workflow match your processes?
- **Event Model** - Can you build the automations you need?
- **Operational Fit** - Does NATS JetStream fit your infrastructure?

## üìã Decision Framework

### Adoption Readiness Signals
‚úÖ **Green Light Indicators**:
- Team has Rust experience or willingness to learn
- Need for approval gates in automation
- Event-driven architecture aligns with plans
- Can operate NATS JetStream infrastructure
- Security and compliance requirements match capabilities

üü° **Yellow Light Considerations**:
