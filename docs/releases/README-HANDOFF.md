# Demon Project - Release Snapshot & Handoff

## Current State Summary

**Status**: Ready for handoff with placeholder deployment stabilized
**Date**: September 25, 2025
**Last Update**: Registry credential support added
**Last Nightly Run**: 17980866005 (CrashLoopBackOff resolved, registry credentials implemented)

### Bootstrapper Infrastructure Status

‚úÖ **Core K8s Deployment**: Fully functional
- All 6/6 pods reach Ready state consistently
- Namespace creation, service deployment, and RBAC all working
- Bootstrap process completes end-to-end successfully

‚úÖ **Placeholder Approach**: Stable and documented
- Using `nginx:alpine` placeholder containers for all 3 components (runtime, engine, operate-ui)
- Health checks automatically detect placeholder mode and adapt accordingly
- Clear TODO markers for transition to real Docker images

‚úÖ **Enhanced Health Checks**: Placeholder-aware validation
- Automatic detection of placeholder vs production images
- Graceful fallback to container status checks for placeholders
- Maintains full HTTP endpoint validation for real images

‚úÖ **Registry Credential Support**: Added in 2025-09-25
- Configurable support for Docker Hub and private registry authentication
- Environment variable-based credential sourcing
- imagePullSecrets automatically created and applied per-component
- Backward compatible (optional feature)

### Testing Matrix Results

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| `cargo fmt` | ‚úÖ Pass | Code formatting clean |
| `cargo clippy` | ‚úÖ Pass | No warnings |
| `cargo test --workspace` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | 2 vault-related test failures due to env var race conditions (non-blocking) |
| Dry-run validation | ‚úÖ Pass | Configuration and manifest generation working |
| Full smoke test | üîÑ Ready | Health check fix applied, waiting for nightly validation |

### Outstanding Issues

#### Fixed in This Dispatch
- **Health check failures**: Resolved by implementing automatic placeholder detection
- **Pod labeling confusion**: Corrected label selectors in health check logic
- **Error messaging**: Improved to be more actionable

#### Known Test Flakiness (Non-blocking)
- Vault integration tests have race conditions when run in parallel
- Workaround: Run with `--test-threads=1` for CI or development
- Root cause: Global environment variable manipulation in concurrent tests

### Docker Infrastructure Status

From `DOCKER_PIPELINE_PLAN.md`, phases:

#### Phase 1: Dockerfiles ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-10-02)
- ‚úÖ **Created multi-stage Dockerfiles** for operate-ui, runtime, and engine
  - Uses cargo-chef for efficient dependency caching
  - Alpine-based builder, distroless runtime (secure & minimal)
  - Image sizes: operate-ui (~34MB), runtime (~13MB), engine (~5MB)
- ‚úÖ **Validated local builds** for all three components
- ‚úÖ **Documentation updated** in component READMEs with build/run instructions
- See commit: PR TBD

#### Phase 2: CI/CD Workflow (NEXT)
- [ ] Implement GitHub Actions workflow to build and push images to GHCR
- [ ] Tag strategy and versioning
- [ ] Multi-arch builds (amd64/arm64)

#### Phase 3: K8s Integration
- [ ] Update K8s manifests to reference GHCR images
- [ ] Remove placeholder nginx images
- [ ] Restore HTTP health checks for real services

**Timeline Estimate**: Phase 2-3 implementation ~1-2 weeks

### File Changes Made

#### Core Health Check Fix
- `scripts/tests/smoke-k8s-bootstrap.sh`: Enhanced with automatic placeholder detection
  - Lines 339-350: Placeholder mode detection logic
  - Lines 358-390: Conditional health checking (placeholder vs real)
  - Lines 397-474: Applied to all three components (runtime, UI, engine)

#### Documentation Updates
- `scripts/tests/smoke-k8s-bootstrap.sh`: Updated header comments to reflect new capability
- `docs/releases/README-HANDOFF.md`: This handoff document

### Validation Commands

For the next team member to verify current state:

```bash
# Verify code quality
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --test-threads=1

# Validate placeholder deployment works
# (requires k3d/kind installation)
make bootstrap-smoke ARGS="--dry-run-only --verbose"
make bootstrap-smoke ARGS="--verbose --cleanup"
```

### Next Deployment Test

After merging these changes, the next nightly run should:
1. Deploy all 6 pods successfully (runtime, engine, operate-ui, nats, prometheus, grafana)
2. Detect placeholder mode automatically
3. Pass all placeholder health checks
4. Complete with green status

**Expected Success Criteria**:
- All pods reach Ready state within 240s
- Health checks pass with "placeholder mode detected" messages
- No "No demon-runtime pod found" errors

### Monitoring & Follow-up

**Immediate next steps**:
1. Monitor next nightly run (ID will be 17960+ series)
2. Validate that health check improvements resolve the deployment failures
3. Begin Docker infrastructure implementation per `DOCKER_PIPELINE_PLAN.md`

**Long-term handoff checklist**:
- [ ] Confirm nightly validation passes consistently
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 of Docker pipeline (Dockerfile creation)
- [ ] Plan migration strategy from placeholders to real images
- [ ] Update project board to reflect current status

### Support Context

This project has:
- **Comprehensive documentation** in `docs/examples/k8s-bootstrap/README.md`
- **Detailed planning** in `DOCKER_PIPELINE_PLAN.md`
- **Governance framework** in `docs/process/PM_REBOOT_PLAYBOOK.md`
- **CI automation** for both PR validation and nightly testing

The handoff is designed to be seamless with no immediate action required beyond monitoring the next automated validation run.
