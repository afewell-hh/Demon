    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (rsa: Marvin attack - timing side-channel on RSA decryption).
    # Justification: Demon uses sigstore for signature verification only (public key operations).
    # The Marvin timing attack targets RSA decryption (private key operations), which we do not perform.
    # This advisory does not affect our use case.
    # Expiry: Remove by 2026-01-31 or when sigstore eliminates rsa dependency (verified 2025-11-02: still required).
